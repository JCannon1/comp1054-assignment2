				<h2>M&M's Early Years</h2>
				<p>M&M's were founded in 1941 by Forrest Mars. He thought of the idea for the candy after he saw soliders during the Spanish Civil War eating chocolate pellets. They had a hard coating over them so the soliders were able to carry the candy around with them in hot weather without it melting all over them. This discovery is what started the popular treat everyone enjoys today. Try M&M's today and see for yourself why they are one of the most popular candies in North America.</p>
